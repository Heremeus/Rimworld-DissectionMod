# Rimworld - Medical Dissection
Medical Dissection is a mod for the game Rimworld. The mod adds a dissection table to the game, allowing your doctors to train on human corpses. The mod can be added to existing saves but you will need to fix your work priorities afterwards because it adds a new work type.

# Features
* Performing dissections allows your doctors to train their medicine skill on humanlike corpses
* Colonists assigned to the new "Study Medicine" work type will perform dissection bills at a dissection table to train their skill
* Dissecting a single body takes 1.5 ingame hours and grants 3000xp (adjustable in settings)
* Colonists will not perform dissections if doing so would exceed the daily learn threshold too much
* Dissection removes random body parts and organs from the corpse
* Colonists may accidentally destroy corpses in the dissection process (lower chance with higher medicine skill)
* A corpse can only be dissected once (A "Allow dissected" and "Allow not dissected" filter can help you to set up your storages and butcher bills efficiently)
* Thoughts and tales

## Stuff added by the mod
### Research
A new research project "Dissection" unlocks the Dissection Table. Automatically unlocked for crashlanded scenario for your convenience (they surely heard about the idea of cutting open dead people to learn about human anatomy).
### Buildings
A dissection table to perform the work on (texture kindly provided by /u/Edward_StoneHammer!).
### Recipes/Bills
A dissection recipe/bill. Use the details to allow only certain types of corpses (colonists/stranger) or set a minimum/maximum skill for dissection.
### Work type
A "Study Medicine" work type. Assign your soon-to-be doctors to train their skill without having them accidentally perform organ replacements.
### Filters
A "Allow dissected" and a "Allow not dissected" filter to optimise your storage and bills. Set up your butcher bills to only allow dissected bodies to make sure you are not losing out on experience for your doctors.
### Thoughts
Colonists with a passion for medicine will remember dissecting a corpse and gain a small mood boost for a while (1.5 days). Without a passion they will be disgusted for a few hours before they forget about the things they did(0.5 days).
### Tales
Cutting a corpse open is a memorable experience and people that did like to tell tales about it to their colony. One day you might discover a piece of art portraying their story. These stories are based on the dead person's relationship to your colony and the dissector's passion for medicine.
### Settings
The mod settings (Escape -> Options -> Mod Settings) allow you to tweak and balance the mod to your likings. You can adjust the amount experience gained and choose to ignore the daily learning limit. You can also adjust the chance of the corpse being destroyed in the process. The setting value is the chance for a colonist with 0 medicine skill. The actual chance is lower for higher skill levels (for example half as much with level 6 and only a tenth with level 14).

# Compatibility
There are no known incompatibilities with other mods. Please let me know if you encounter any issues.
### Harvest Organs Post Mortem
The mod contains a patch for Harvest Organs Post Mortem (HOPM). If HOPM is installed, you can add dissection bills on autopsy tables. The required research changes to Basic Autopsy. The dissection table is still available but can only be used for dissections, not for organ harvesting.
### Alien races
The mod currently only allows dissection on humanlike races.
Mods based on "Humanoid Alien Races 2.0" by erdelf are supported.
[Add an issue](https://github.com/Heremeus/DissectionMod/issues) if you would like to dissect non-humanlike races. Please include the name of the mod adding that race.
### Save game compatibility
The mod can be added to existing saves but you will need to fix your work priorities afterwards because it adds a new work type.
It is not safe to remove the mod from an existing save after doing the first dissection.
